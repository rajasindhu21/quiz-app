# quiz-app
I’ve developed a quiz app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that offers a simple and interactive user experience. The app presents multiple-choice questions, tracks your score, and provides instant feedback after each answer. It’s designed with a clean, responsive interface to ensure smooth gameplay across different devices. This project helped me improve my front-end skills and knowledge of JavaScript functionality.
This quiz app provides an engaging experience by instantly highlighting correct answers in green and incorrect ones in red. After each wrong answer, the correct answer is displayed, ensuring users learn as they play. Once all questions are completed, the app gives a total score, and players can easily restart the quiz for another round of fun and learning!
